You can also use codio to build the app!

To build the app, enter the following in the terminal:
```
./gradlew build
```

If you receive a permission denied error, enter the following:
```
chmod +x gradlew
```
And run the ./gradlew build command again

If the project builds correctly, enter the following URL on your android device to download the apk:

https://{codio domain}/app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk

The domain for your codio box is listed at the top of your terminal window
